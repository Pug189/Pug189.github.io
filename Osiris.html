XONOVELIXI ⇌ Made of metal, electrified, has swords for arms.<br><br>
Izzy and Pug approach, noticing that it has only melee attacks and not much mobility besides running.<br>
Izzy runs from and around it, while Pug is on top casting things. Every time it swings at them Pug (8114 L)s the arm, making it bounce off harmlessly. When it runs at them Pug does the same thing except to it, occasionally redirecting velocity differently.<br>
Flesh can bruise and bones can break, but metal dents and it does so permanently. If they dented this thing enough, chances are it would cease to be animated.<br>
Pug took the force of Izzy running and converted it to potential energy, applying it in pin-sized sections on the xonovelixi to create holes and dents. The force was also used to swing it upwards, leaving a detrimental dent when it hit the ground. From there they made sure it wasn't alive, then left. The metal body makes harvesting the skull for Silphusiris quite difficult, so the body was left and picked up at a later date.<br><br>02<br><br>
XONOVELIXI ⇌ Teleports via heat and/or light, can manipulate senses.<br><br>
Izzy and Pug walk into the room. They don't see it.
Izzy injects a volt fractal and runs around the room, hitting something that they can't see. He bites down, then the lights in the room blink and it gets colder as it disappears from his grip. They sit quietly, not knowing where it went. The dust on one of the walls starts drifting with no cause.<br>
Pug throws a volt fractal, the explosion suddenly disappearing like it never happened. Their senses are being altered. Visuals, touch, temperature, and sound are being masked. Smell isn't, noted by the fact that Izzy can smell the soot, smoke, and dust from the explosion. Izzy follows the smell of iron, which is indicating blood. The xonovelixi realizes its mistake, covering smell as well. They note that it might try to escape, so we sit in front of the door. To make sure the door is actually closed and not an illusion, Pug swings it via his trait, which is quite difficult to decode and replicate in just a couple seconds. The door swings as expected. It's still in the room.<br>
In an attempt to try and make the xonovelixi think he's dead and lift the illusion hiding itself, Izzy runs into a wall and pretends to be dead or unconscious. Pug pokes and shoves him, trying to sell the idea that he doesn't know what's going on or if he's okay. Pug returns to the door and promptly get punched by something he can't see. He runs to the opposite side of the room from the door, trying to look for anything that could indicate where it is. Izzy, however, sees Pug run towards him with the xonovelixi visible and walking towards him. Izzy jumps up and bites at the entity's leg, but the illusions vanish and a new one appears.
Pug is by the door, unconscious, with nothing else visible in the room. Meanwhile Pug is actually still opposite the door, getting closer to Izzy as he fights with the xonovelixi. Izzy lunges at the empty air, knocking over and landing on something. It's invisible.<br>
Since Pug doesn't want to get bitten, he starts patting Izzy on the head trying to signal that it's him and not the xonovelixi. If it were the xonovelixi it would have teleported away by now, and Izzy picks up on that. Just in case the petting is a manipulated cover for the entity hitting Izzy on the head repeatedly, they grab Pug's hand in his mouth. He flinches, but doesn't pull back. Pug is still not sure where the xonovelixi is, so he wants to start moving. He squirms under Izzy, trying to get himself free. Izzy obliges, keeping his hand in his mouth to make sure he doesn't go anywhere.<br>
As they're walking back to the door, their safe spot, Pug gets hit on the shoulder. He throws his last volt fractal towards where the impact came from, getting a near direct hit and knocking the entity down onto the floor. From Izzy's perspective the whole room suddenly went dark and cold, his ears ringing. The room was cold, however his side closest to the blast was warm. Warmer than it was with the body heat of Pug from laying on him. Not knowing what is going on, Izzy did what he does best. Prepared to run around.
He let go of Pug's hand, turned back to a human, stabbed himself with his last volt fractal, turned towards the heat of the blast, and ran full force towards the xonovelixi, kicking it straight in the face. Funnily enough that was what finished it off, and light was restored to the room. Considering this xonovelixi has both blood and bones, both of which are needed for Silphusiris, Izzy took the body and stored it in an unused freezer in his garage to preserve it. As for the metal xonovelixi still outside, that was taken to the garage and left on the ground. Power tools can most likely cut through the metal and separate the skull, which would allow them to take it to the shop.<br><br>03<br><br>
XONOVELIXI ⇌ Bow with homing arrows, can add velocity to self<br><br>
Izzy ran at it<br>
Bit its leg<br>
Rammed it over<br>
Bit its head<br>
Bit its neck<br>
It was a very short encounter<br>
The body has joined the other in the freezer<br><br>04<br><br>
XONOVELIXI ⇌ Siphons air from the room, can split and merge its body parts at will.<br><br>
Pug and Izzy ran into the room directly at it. Haste was necessary because they were going to suffocate if they took too long.
Izzy went to bite its head, but it split itself and distanced itself from us. Pug just reversed the head's velocity and made it turn right back around. Once Izzy bit the head, the rest of the body merged but the skull was separated. It bled out and died shortly after, but air pressure wasn't restored. Izzy ran at the door, and Pug used his velocity to pop the hinges out of the door. He turned the door knob, but failed to remember that the pressure in the room was less than the pressure outside. The door flew straight into their faces. Pug put the door back, and put the body and the conveniently separated skull in the freezer with the rest of everything. Doors hurt a lot.<br><br>05<br><br>
XONOVELIXI ⇌ 2x the regular human size, has a flail with a longer knife-like mace handle, and muffles sounds around itself.<br><br>
Pug and Izzy were discussing what they should do about it outside. They couldn't really get near it without getting hit.<br>
While they were discussing this, however, the xonovelixi swung the weapon at the door and destroyed a section of the wall. Pug distanced myself from the impact zone and shot into the room with the bow artifact from E-03, however Izzy ran directly at it. It swung at him and scraped his back, but due to his speed he was able to avoid the full hit. Izzy jumped on it, and at this point the flail-part of the weapon was useless.<br>
The xonovelixi stabbed at him and punched him in the head, but he was able to get a lot of bites and tears in before he had to get away. During this time of it being distracted by Izzy, Pug managed to land two more arrow shots on it. One in the eye, and one in the side of its head. Due to blood loss and head damage it fell over on its own, and it was left to bleed. The body of the xonovelixi was left for animals and such, but someone will be going back after a while to check on it. If it's been eaten to the point of bones being the near-last thing left, they will take them to the garage. Otherwise wait longer. Due to the entity's size it's probably enough bone weight for a drive-imprisoner, but the exact weight needs to be checked at the shop.<br><br>
06<br><br>

XONOVELIXI ⇌ Has a hexproof sword and a crown that allows it to teleport.<br><br>

Izz and Pug ran in and Pug attempted to swing the crown off.<br>
The crown didn't move.<br>
The entity teleported towards them and tried to stab Izz, but he ran away before it could.<br>
It teleported once more and because of some miscommunication Izz polymorphed back to a human, knocking Pug off and giving the entity an opportunity to stab him. It did, then teleported away. Presumably on top of the building or outside of it. Izz polymorphed back to a dog, and Pug got on their back. Movement hurt too much for him to do it on his own.<br>
He pressed a volt fractal against the wound, making him at least able to walk if necessary. Izz ran around the room trying to figure out where it went, and it teleported back in. It tried to stab him, but failed. Using this as an opportunity, Izz spun around and lunged at it, biting its leg. Due to how the crown works, it was unable to teleport away. The xonovelixi stabbed Izz in the head, but due to the nature of how his matter scaling works it wasn't a lethal hit. To prevent himself from getting stabbed a second time, Pug got off of Izz's back and stumbled backwards, equipping a Korzan Apparatus. Izz was hurt extremely bad, but he was still alive. He yanked at its leg, knocking it over. That gave Pug enough time to jump in and drill the xonovelixi's face in with the KA, and that was the end of that. The body was taken to the freezer like the others, and Pug took the crown.<br>

<div class="panel" id="silphusiris" style="display: block;"><p style="font-size:1.5em;">
[1] Shard of the Inbetween (SOTI).<br>Cost : Two skulls of Xonovelixis.<br>Revives the carrier after a short amount time if they happen to die. Can be used once every two weeks.<br><br>

[2] Drive Imprisoner.<br>Cost : A sample of a xonovelixi with intact cells + Approximately 10 kg of bones from any source.<br>Grants the buyer what Osiris granted the Xonovelixi. Entity, power, object, it stacks with your current trait.<br><br>

[3] Void Coin.<br>Cost : Blood from the buyer and blood from a xonovelixi (Amounts of blood do not matter, it's always one coin).<br>Transports the carrier to a limbo-like state for a second after being flipped. The carrier becomes intangible and immovable for its duration. Can be reused if caught, but if it falls on the ground after being flipped then it is no longer usable.<br><br>

[4] Volt Fractal.<br>Cost : None, can be bought for free once a week.<br>Glass crystal, gives the user a burst of energy and a slipstream of speed for a few minutes. Feels like a jolt of electricity when used via stabbing yourself with it. One-use, and if it breaks before usage it explodes.<br><br>

[5] Circuit Breaker.<br>Cost : Any non-living non-cellular section or part from a xonovelixi.<br>A curved dagger which, upon being thrown, homes towards the nearest Xonovelixi's head, neck, or chest. The circuit being broken, in this case, is the xonovelixi's body and/or organs. Note that it even homes in on invisible entities.<br><br>

[6] Hexblade.<br>Cost : Three volt fractals and a void coin.<br>A very sharp unbreakable sword that cannot be targetted by any entities, powers, or other objects. It almost doesn't exist.<br><br>

[7] Jumpstone.<br>Cost : Any physiris object from a xonovelixi.<br>A spherical, smooth, shiny gem of a random color. It passively generates energy and can be drawn upon as a power source substitute no matter your trait. Each pound of the object used to create it is another 1,000 joules of energy it is capable of holding. It generates 10 joules per minute.<br><br>

[8] Korzan Apparatus.<br>Cost : Hexblade and a Jumpstone.<br>A black, metallic, full-arm gauntlet with streaks of red. The hand can morph between a glove, blade, sledgehammer, drill, and flamethrower. It provides energy to itself and the user, charging at 100 joules per minute up to 100,000 joules. The drill and flamethrower take additional energy for obvious reasons. Adapts to the user's hand shape.<br><br>
 
[9] Isoblade.<br>Cost : Three volt fractals and a Circuit Breaker.<br>A long, thin, incredibly sharp sword that makes a crystal-like tinkling sound when tapped on. Despite being thin, it's surprisingly good at staying in one piece. Anything cut with the sword will reform a few seconds after. If something was cut into separate pieces and the pieces were separated before they could reform, the reversion does not work. Great for dueling as long as you don't cut each other apart!<br><br>

[10] Xenegynn Apparatus.<br>Cost : Isoblade and a Jumpstone.<br>A black, metallic, full-arm gauntlet with streaks of cyan. The hand can morph between a glove, blade, crystal shield, crossbow, and cryo-misting device. It provides energy to itself and the user, charging at 100 joules per minute up to 100,000 joules. The crossbow takes additional energy, and the cryo-mister actually restores energy by having an in-take of thermal energy. Adapts to the user's hand shape.<br><br>

[11] Isofield Beacon.<br>Cost : Isoblade and a Circuit Breaker.<br>A pole that, when stuck into the ground, creates a cylindrical field around it that keeps everything in and keeps everything out. The field will be returned to how it was when it was activated after five seconds, deactivating until taken out of the ground. It reverts the time in the area, essentially. It also creates a temporary barrier as a side-effect of how it works.<br><br>

<b>The numbers beside an item shows the minimum waves cleared before it can be bought and the required kg of bones required to purchase it.</b><br>
<br>
[1 / 2.5kg] Nerve Taurus (A ring made of pearl that is made to fit the buyer. It has three uses, can be used when worn, and prevents the user from feeling anything for 30 seconds while active. It numbs the entire body. It can make it difficult to walk and such, but it allows you to continue fighting even when you're in a lot of pain.)<br>
<br>
[2 / 5kg] Berserker's Tonic (A bottle that voids itself once empty. It contains a liquid that, when ingested, makes your body operate faster than usual. You'll be breathing faster, punching harder, running faster, and getting tired faster. The duration depends on the amount you drink, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes)<br>
<br>
[3 / 5kg] Osseous Ram (A very light, long-handled bat that moves through materials like they're not even there while the grip is held. The exception to this is bone. You could break someone's arm but not leave a scratch on their skin. The weapon will void a section of itself if it is overlapping with another material and the grip is released.)<br>
<br>
[4 / 10kg] Grappling Glove (Allows you to grapple, swing, and pull yourself into empty space by simply reaching out and making your hand into a fist. On arrival you'll start falling, so you need to continuously grapple to stay in the air. Grappling in one direction and the grappling perpendicularly will make you spin.)<br>
<br>
[5 / 7.5kg] Chronologic Sash (Allows the wearer to revert time five seconds. One time use. This can be used even after death. Note that reverting doesn't refresh its use. It's one-time, that's permanent. The user retains memory of the next five seconds, nothing else does. If you see someone twitch in a strange way, chances are they used this. If they were punching something when they used the sash, they'll continue moving their arm for a moment.)
